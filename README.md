# Round Robin Scheduling
Round Robin Scheduling.cpp is simple program engineered using C++ language 
 1. Launch the program: Round Robin Scheduling.cpp using CodeBlocks or other C++ compiler.
      
	 * The program will take inputs
 2. Number of Processes: Input the total number of processes, ensuring it's a positive integer. 
                         Non-integer inputs will display error messages.
 3. Quantum Time: Specify the time quantum for the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, ensuring it's a positive integer. 
                  Non-integer inputs will display error messages.
 4. For each process:
    4.1. Arrival Time: Enter the arrival time, ensuring it's a non-negative integer. 
                       Non-integer inputs will display error messages.
    4.2. Service Time: Enter the CPU service time required by the process, ensuring it's a positive integer.
                       Non-integer inputs will display error messages.
 5. Gantt Chart: View the Gantt Chart, displaying the scheduling sequence and process execution over time.
 6. Average Wait Time: It Calculat the average waiting time experienced by processes in the scheduling algorithm and displays.
 7. Exit the program by entering (0) when prompted.

   Note: In case of unknown keywords, incorrect input or input mismuch
         the program will display error messages and it will ask the user to enter an input again.
